# Delay-optimization-of-logic-path-in-32nm-PDK
Designed and sized the gates â€‘ INV, NAND3 and NOR2 in the logic path using logical effort to minimize the delay and created a testbench in HSPICE to verify the functionality and measured the propagation delay}              \resumeItem{Designed the layout for the gates in Cadence Virtuoso and verified it for DRC and LVS.}             \resumeItem{Extracted parasitics from the layout using starRC and determined the propogation delay
